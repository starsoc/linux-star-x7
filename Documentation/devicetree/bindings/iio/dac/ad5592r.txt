Analog Devices AD5592R DAC/ADC device driver

Required properties:
	- compatible: Must be one of:
		* "adi,ad5592r"
	- reg: SPI chip select number for the device
	- spi-max-frequency: Max SPI frequency to use (< 30000000)
	- spi-cpol: The AD5592R requires inverse clock polarity (CPOL) mode
	- channel-modes: An array of eight 8-bit values (one per channel)
	  describing the mode of each channel according to the following:
		* 0 = unused (pulled down),
		* 1 = DAC,
		* 2 = ADC,
		* 6 = tri-state

Example:

	ad5592r@0 {
		compatible = "adi,ad5592r";
		reg = <0>;
		spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
		spi-cpol;

		channel-modes = /bits/ 8 <1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0>;
	};
